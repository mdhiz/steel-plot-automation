# Steel Plot Report Automation Tool

This project is inspired by my work at Ørsted, where I developed internal Python tools to automate steel reporting for offshore wind monopile design.

It simulates a simplified steel plot generator — used to reduce manual documentation and improve reporting speed in structural design workflows.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Reads structural design parameters from CSV
- Calculates section weights and dimensions
- Outputs clean, readable steel plot report
- Lightweight CLI-ready Python script

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Object-Oriented)
- Pandas, NumPy
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD-ready)
- YAML (workflow automation)
- Markdown (report documentation)
